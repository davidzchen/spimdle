Notes for building QtSPIM on various systems.

All:
        Install the bison parser generator and flex lexer generator, either using Cygwin on Windows or native on Linux.


Windows:
        The Open Source version of Qt Creator for Windows, which uses migw works fine, as does
        the version (which you need to build yourself) that uses Microsoft Visual Studio's C++
        compiler.

Linux:
        The version of Qt Creator that comes with Ubuntu is an old version, which has some problems with QtSPIM.
        Download a recent version from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/.

Mac:

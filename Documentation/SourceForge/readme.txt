This directory contains compiled, installable copies of various flavors of spim:

  QtSpim:

    qtspim_*_linux32.deb -- 32 bit Linux debian package

    QtSpim_*_Windows.zip -- Windows (32 or 64 bit)

    QtSpim_*_mac.dmg     -- Mac OS X

  Linux 64 bit versions are not yet available.


  PCSpim:
    PCSpim_*.zip         -- Windows (32 or 64 bit)


Note: * is the version number, e.g. 9.0.1


These may not be the latest version of spim. Since spim is used in classes, I try not to change these files
during the semester, so all students run the same program. If you want the latest version, go to the
repository, download the source, and compile it.

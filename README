                                      GETTING SPIM SOURCE
                                      ===================

Spim is hosted on SourceForge and its source code is available through SVN:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/


                                          DIRECTORIES
                                          ===========

The subdirectories can be divided into two categories.

1. Common to all versions of Spim:

    CPU -- Contains the MIPS simulator and some utility functions common to all version of the
           simulator.

    Documentation -- Contains the man pages, web page, and other documentation.

    bin -- Utilities.

    Setup -- Contain tools used to build deployable versions of the simulators.

    Tests -- Contains regression test for the simulator.

    Boneyard -- Copies of the recent releases of Spim.


2. Front-ends for different versions of Spim:

    PCSpim -- Microsoft Windows front end for Spim.

    QtSpim -- Front end for Spim that works on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

    spim -- Text-only (terminal or console) front end for Spim. Works on all platforms.

    xspim -- X-Windows front end for Spim. Works on Linux and Mac OS X. (Built on a very old
             X Windows library that is no longer supported by the Mac.)


                                        BUILDING QTSPIM
                                        ===============

It is generally not necessary to build QtSpim as the Spim website contains an installable
version for most systems.

Install the bison parser generator and flex lexer generator, either using Cygwin on Windows or
native on Linux.

1. Download the free (open source) version of Qt Creator from
   http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/. This is a large download that might take a while.

        The open source version of Qt Creator for Windows, which uses mingw works fine, as does
        the version (which you need to build yourself) that uses Microsoft Visual Studio's C++
        compiler.

        The version of Qt Creator that comes with Ubuntu is an old version, which has some
        problems with QtSPIM.  Download a recent version from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/.

        The Mac Qt SDK is located at http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-mac-os-cpp.

2. Start QtCreator and open the file QtSpim/QtSpim.pro.

3. Compile QtSpim.

        If you are porting to a new system, and see a large number of compiler errors in
        QtCreator, changes are good that you need to change QtSpim.pro to define the compiler
        flag that says "treat all files, including .c files, as C++ code. This flag is "-X C++"
        for gcc and "-TP" for the Microsoft compiler.


                                    BUILDING SPIM and XSPIM
                                    =======================

It is necessary to build spim and xspim, as they are only distributed as source.

To build spim (the terminal version) or xspim (the X-windows and Mac version):

1. Change to the directory "spim" to build spim. Change to the directory "xspim" to build xspim

2. If necessary, edit the first few non-comment lines of the Makefile (or the Imakefile if you
are building xspim) to set the pathnames for your system:

	EXCEPTION_DIR -- The full pathname of the directory in which to install the SPIM
			 exception handler.

	BIN_DIR -- The full pathname of the directory in which spim and xspim should be
		   installed.

	MAN_DIR -- The full pathname of the directory in which the manual pages for spim and
		   xspim should be installed.

In general, the remaining parameters need not be changed.


3. If you are building spim type:

	% make


4. If you are building xspim, type:

	% xmkmf
	% make

5. To run spim or xspim, the exception handler code must be installed in the directory specified
by the variable EXCEPTION_DIR in the Makefile.  If the file "exceptions."s is not installed,
spim and xspim fail with a message before they start running.  You can either install this file
by hand or by typing

	% make install

which also installs spim, xspim, and the manual pages in the directories that you set
(above). If you use the default paths, then you will need root permissions to install the files,
so instead type:

	% sudo make install

This will prompt you for the root password.


6. To test that spim builds correctly, in the "spim" directory type

	% make test

and examine the output of the test.  (Note: the exception handler must be installed before
running the test.)


                                        BUILDING PCSPIM
                                        ===============

It is not necessary to compile PCSpim (the Microsoft Windows version), as the Spim web site
contains a precompiled version.

The Microsoft Windows version of Spim is called PCSpim and is built using Microsoft Visual
Studio.

spim (the terminal version) works well on Microsoft Windows.  You can easily build it using the
Cygwin port of the GNU tools (see www.cygwin.com).



                                      NEW VERSIONS OF SPIM
                                      ===================

I generally release new version of SPIM once a year, before a semester boundary (late August or
early January).  The new version are available on:
